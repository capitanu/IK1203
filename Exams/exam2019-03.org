-- http request for x objects:
response = http ok + nr of objects = x + 1

--TCP CAN BE USED WITH IP MULTICAST
TCP decides how large segments to send

-- ARP broadcast does not exist, instead a switch sends the packet to all the ports

-- Switch saves MAC address when receiving a packet (saves sender MAC address)
* Section B

** 1)
RTT = 4 ms
rwnd = 16kB
MSS(0) = 2kB
Total = 64 kB

6 ms = connection time
4 ms = 2kB
4 ms = 4 kB
4 ms = 8 kB
4 ms = 16 kB
4 ms = 16 kB
4 ms = 16 kB
2/4 ms = 2 kB

Total time = either 38 or 40 ms (if we consider the last ACK to the sender 34 if not, 32)

** 2)

*** a)
F asks for the MAC address of R2
*** b)
F uses FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
*** c)
Hose E and router R2 will get it.
*** d)

Switch table:
MACb / port south
MAC R1 / port east
** 3)
*** a)
Local DNS server: KTH's local DNS server checks if it has the request in the cache, if not, asks ROOT DNS server
Root DNS server: Reads the request and sends the location of the TLD DNS Server that handles that top level domain.
TLD Server: Knows the location of the Authorative DNS Server.
Authorative DNS Server: Answers with the correct IP address.

*** b)

UDP CAN'T TRUNCATE MESSAGES!!!
It is not possible.
** 4)
** 5)
*** a)
192.16.8.132 - 111.15.17.32/m0
192.16.7.13 - 193.14.5.193/m1
194.17.22.12 - 111.30.31.18/m0
193.14.5.198 - 193.14.5.198/m1
*** b)

No because the upper bits will not be the same.
